<h1>Portfolio Page Summary</h1>
<p>This is the start of my portfolio, hosted through GitHub Pages.  This is also my first time using HTML, so please forgive me if the formatting is a bit rough.</p>

<h2>Programming Experience/Projects</h2>
<p> <a href="https://felix-dubois.itch.io">This is a link to my itch.io profile</a>, where I host the game projects that I've completed.  So far, all of these projects were created as part of the Godot Wild Jam, a monthly game jam focusing on entries made in the open-source Godot engine.  While my itch.io page serves as a functional abbreviated portfolio, I will talk about each of these projects in a bit more detail here to provide context as to provide more insight to how I contributed to each project in addition to what I learned in the process. Projects will be shown and discussed in reverse chronological order (most recent first)</p>
<h3>Reflectix</h3>

<p>My most recent project, Reflectix is a turn-based strategy game for two players, similar to chess.  Players take turns moving and rotating mirrors with the goal of hitting their opponent's laser emitter.  The game is heavily inspired by a board game called Khet 2.0, but differs in a few key ways, such as imposing less restrictions on the amount a piece may be rotated on a turn and allowing players to move their laser emitters.  I was responsible for the project idea and initial design (note to self: link to design document here), in addition to a lot of programming on the core systems (such as displaying lasers and having them either reflect off of or destroy pieces, enforcing turn order, rotating pieces, and restarting the game after a player wins) and playing a key part in directing the efforts of my two team members.  One of the other team members is responsible for the sound, the system for selecting and moving pieces, and spent a lot of time polishing many aspects of the game.  The third team member was responsible for pixel art.  This was my first game jam with a programming team member where we both worked on core parts of the game, and also the first game jam where I'm reasonably happy with how the game turned out given the time restraints.  The main limitation of this game is that it only supports local two-player, though we plan to keep working on the game to add online play and/or a vs CPU mode.  This game was made between the dates of November 8 and November 17, 2024 using Godot 4.3</p>
<h3>Haunted Lab</h3>
<p>My second-most recent project, Haunted Lab is a short horror game in which players must scavenge for parts in a lab while being chased by a ghost. The jam version of this game was made between the dates of October 11 and October 20, 2024.  This was a solo project, meaning I was responsible for all aspects of the game including art, sound, design and programming.  Unfortunately I once again overscoped the project early on, and I also spent more time on the artwork than I intended to.  As a result, some of the programming was put off until the last day and done poorly due to time constraints, and the jam version of the game generally did not function well.  </p> I later spent an additional week (October 31 through November 7, 2024) refining the downscoped version of the game in order to learn what went wrong and prevent similar issues in future, resulting in the most recent version.

<p>This was the first game jam that I joined.  After some initial efforts on a solo project, I decided to join a team that was looking for a second pixel artist.  This team worked on and submitted a game called "Staring Back", planned as a top-down dungeon crawler.  I primarily did sprite work on the player character and some enemies, in addition to a title and credits screen. A lot of this sprite work ended up unused, and although plans to continue working on the project post-jam were discussed, communication with the other team members largely ceased after the jam.</p>
<h3> Alternate sprite for LttP</h3>

A note written in unused areas of the sprite sheet reads 'HAPPY HOLIDAYS! to: Spiffers the Grand (from pfp)  This is my first sprite, sorry it's rough but I hope you like it!!  from Felix DuBois.'" title="LttP sprite sheet for Spiffers the Grand">
<p>My first attempt at pixel art in any format.  I made this as part of a "Secret Santa" event on the Archipelago discord server.  The premise of the event was that each gifter was responsible for choosing randomization settings for their giftee among games that they played, and as part of customizing my giftee's Link to the Past game, I decided to make a custom sprite based off of the user's Discord profile picture.  This sprite sheet (with formatting dictated by the base game's sprite sheet for Link) was made between the dates of December 13 and December 19, 2023 using GIMP 2.0(note to self add some animation gifs and maybe the pfp later)</p>
