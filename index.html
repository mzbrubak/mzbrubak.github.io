<h1>Portfolio Page Summary</h1>
<p>This is the start of my portfolio, hosted through GitHub Pages.  This is also my first time using HTML, so please forgive me if the formatting is a bit rough.</p>

<h2>Programming Experience/Projects</h2>
<p> <a href="https://felix-dubois.itch.io">This is a link to my itch.io profile</a>, where I host the game projects that I've completed.  So far, all of these projects were created as part of the Godot Wild Jam, a monthly game jam focusing on entries made in the open-source Godot engine.  While my itch.io page serves as a functional abbreviated portfolio, I will talk about each of these projects in a bit more detail here to provide context as to provide more insight to how I contributed to each project in addition to what I learned in the process. Projects will be shown and discussed in reverse chronological order (most recent first)</p>
<h3>Reflectix</h3>

<h2>Art Portfolio</h2>
<p> As with my programming portfolio, I will be showing assets used for various projects in reverse chronological order, along with commentary.</p>

<h3> Alternate sprite for LttP</h3>
<img src="Spiffers.png" alt="A sprite sheet featuring a blue 'My Little Pony'-style horse.  A note written in unused areas of the sprite sheet reads 'HAPPY HOLIDAYS! to: Spiffers the Grand (from pfp)  This is my first sprite, sorry it's rough but I hope you like it!!  from Felix DuBois.'" title="LttP sprite sheet for Spiffers the Grand">
<p>My first attempt at pixel art in any format.  I made this as part of a "Secret Santa" event on the Archipelago discord server.  The premise of the event was that each gifter was responsible for choosing randomization settings for their giftee among games that they played, and as part of customizing my giftee's Link to the Past game, I decided to make a custom sprite based off of the user's Discord profile picture.  This sprite sheet (with formatting dictated by the base game's sprite sheet for Link) was made between the dates of December 13 and December 19, 2023 using GIMP 2.0(note to self add some animation gifs and maybe the pfp later)</p>
