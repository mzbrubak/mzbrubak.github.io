<h1>Portfolio Page Summary</h1>
<p>This is the start of my portfolio, hosted through GitHub Pages.  This is also my first time using HTML, so please forgive me if the formatting is a bit rough.</p>

<h2>Programming Experience/Projects</h2>
<p> <a href="https://felix-dubois.itch.io">This is a link to my itch.io profile</a>, where I host the game projects that I've completed.  So far, all of these projects were created as part of the Godot Wild Jam, a monthly game jam focusing on entries made in the open-source Godot engine.  While my itch.io page serves as a functional abbreviated portfolio, I will talk about each of these projects in a bit more detail here to provide context as to provide more insight to how I contributed to each project in addition to what I learned in the process. Projects will be shown and discussed in reverse chronological order (most recent first)</p>
